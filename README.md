# Nicoles-Work
Python project for interacting with .CSV files.


Task 1: Writing a simple python program that reads the funded file as a CSV as input and searches into a folder (that exists only on my machine) to find the right files (per each client) and copy them into a new folder.

Task 2: Label all copied files

Task 3: Writing a a python program to process the labeled files and group the msgs and compile them into a tabular file (along with the mini-apps)
